### Suggested Additional Questions:
1. Have you ever taken a programming or computer science course before? (If so, where and when?)
2. Which programming languages have you used, if any?
3. Have you created any personal programming projects outside of class?
4. How would you rate your overall programming experience level?

### Survey Sections to Include:
- About You (demographics, background)

- Learning Preferences (modalities, study habits)
- Goals & Motivation (why taking course, career relevance)
- Prior Learning & Experience (customize for CS/programming)
- Confidence & Mindset (growth mindset, anxiety levels)
- Time & Responsibilities (work, caregiving, study time)
- Technology & Environment (devices, internet, study locations)

## Part 3: Concept Pretest

### Requirements:
- **Grading policy**: Clearly state this is graded for **sincere completion only**, not correctness
- **Purpose**: Assess baseline knowledge to personalize instruction
- **Format**: 10-12 questions mixing True/False and Multiple Choice
- **Content**: Draw from weekly learning objectives listed below
- **Include**: "Not sure" option for all questions

### Question Topics (from Weekly LOs):
Create questions covering these concepts:
- Drawing shapes on a Cartesian/pixel coordinate system
- Functions, parameters, and parameter passing
- Variables (declaration, reading, modifying)
- Expressions and calculations
- Abstraction with variables
- Animation using `draw()` function
- Mouse interaction
- Function definitions (custom vs. built-in)
- Local vs. global variables
- Conditional statements
- Boolean variables and expressions
- Loops (while, for, nested)
- Arrays (creation, indexing, methods)
- Objects (properties, methods, OOP concepts)

### Sample Question Formats:
- **True/False**: "A variable in programming is a named storage location that can hold a value."
- **Multiple Choice**: "What is the purpose of the `draw()` function in animation?" with 4-5 options including "Not sure"

## Part 4: What's Next

### Requirements:
- Preview Chapter 2 content
- Build excitement about hands-on coding
- Explain what students will learn:
  - Drawing with JavaScript and P5.js
  - Using coordinate systems
  - Creating and using variables
  - Writing their first interactive programs

### Include:
- Brief description of upcoming topics
- Tips for success (experiment, practice, use AI tutor, have fun)
- Pre-chapter checklist (access to CodeLab, Chrome browser, syllabus review, etc.)
- Motivational closing statement

---

## HTML Styling Requirements

### Design Specifications:
- **Professional and clean** design appropriate for academic textbook
- **Responsive layout** with max-width container
- **Clear visual hierarchy** using headings, colors, and spacing
- **Color scheme**: Blues and neutrals (URI brand compatible)
- **Distinct sections** with visual separators or background colors
- **Form elements** styled consistently for survey and pretest
- **Info boxes** for important notices (colored borders/backgrounds)
- **Readable typography** with appropriate line spacing

### Styling Elements to Include:
- Title with chapter number
- Section headers (h2, h3)
- Info boxes (for survey intro, pretest grading policy, etc.)
- Form inputs (radio buttons, checkboxes, text fields, dropdowns)
- Lists with proper styling
- Footer with course information

## Weekly Learning Objectives Reference

Use these to create pretest questions:

### Variables & Drawing:
- Program with Javascript to draw shapes and color them on a cartesian/pixel coordinate (X,Y) system
- Explain the notion of functions, parameters and parameter passing using commands like `rect` and `ellipse`
- Explain what a Javascript variable is and how it is declared, read and modified
- Program a Javascript single-operator expression using a variable and number to calculate a new value
- Program a simple computer science algorithm, such as swapping variable values
- Explain how variables can be used to abstract values making for easy program changes
- Trace code with variables using memory diagrams

### Animation & Interaction:
- Program animation in ProcessingJS using the `draw()` function
- Program in ProcessingJS responses to user mouse interactions

### Functions:
- Explain the concept and syntax for defining a function and calling a function in Javascript including the concepts of parameters and return values
- Explain how functions can be used to abstract code that you can reuse multiple times in your program
- Program in Javascript using functions that have parameters and return values
- Explain what a built-in library function is and how it differs from a programmer-defined custom function
- Explain the difference between local variables and global variables including where they can be used and where they should be used
- Program in Javascript with local and global variables
- Trace function calls with memory diagrams

### Control Flow:
- Program with Javascript conditional statements
- Explain what a Boolean variable is in Javascript
- Program with a Boolean variable in Javascript
- Explain what a Boolean expression is
- Program with a Boolean expression in Javascript
- Explain what a while loop is including the three parts: what to do over and over, what to change, and how to stop
- Explain the syntax of a for loop in Javascript including its three parts in the beginning of the loop: start, how long to run the loop, and what to change in the loop
- Program with for loops and while loops in Javascript
- Explain what nested loops are including the terms inner loop and outer loop
- Program in Javascript with nested loops

### Data Structures:
- Define and identify data structures, specifically explaining how arrays serve as ordered collections for managing related data
- Create arrays in JavaScript using literal notation (square brackets) to store multiple values of various types
- Access and manipulate specific elements using zero-based indexing to retrieve values or modify array content
- Manage array size and content by utilizing the `.length` property and the `.push()` method to track and expand your data collection

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- Define the concept of an object as a combination of data (properties) and functionality (methods) that models real-world entities
- Contrast object-oriented programming with isolated variables and functions, explaining how objects improve code maintainability and scalability
- Create and manipulate JavaScript objects using curly brace literal notation to define properties and access data
- Identify advanced object-oriented structures, including classes, constructors, and inheritance, to organize complex data and behaviors
